## Our Project
### Species interactions under climate change
How will shifting climate conditions alter species interactions, and what impications will these changes have for ecosystem stability? 


## Group Members
The Team

Dr. Elsa Culler  
Educational Trainer, Engineer and Hydrologist at the CU Boulder Earth Lab.  
Dr. Hsun-Yi Hsieh  
Research Associate at Michigan State University. I work in ecology and environmental data science with a special interest in species interactions.  
Miguel Leon  
Data Scientist at the University of New Hampshire and Information Manager for the Luquillo LTER. I work with ecologists and other earth and environmental scientists on data analysis and publication through the implementation of the FAIR data standard.  
Dr. Yu Liu  
Postdoctoral researcher in LSU. I focus on data science and analyses on solving the ecological questions related to biodiversity and environmental conditions.  
Dr. Brooke Long-Fox  
MorphoBank Data Curation Scientist at Phoenix Bioinformatics and focuses on gender equity for faculty as the ADVANCE Project Coordinator at South Dakota Mines. Brooke is a paleobiologist with experience studying phylogeny and morphology of marine invertebrates.  
Dr. Colleen Miller  
Postdoctoral fellow at the Institute on the Environment at the University of Minnesota. I am an ecologist and data scientist focused on how global change influences species’ physiology and ecology with experience in entomology and ornithology.  
Dr. Pablo Moreno-García  
Postdoctoral researcher in LSU (currently transferring to UA). I work mainly on the effects of global change on species interactions, phenology, and phylogenetic and functional diversity, focusing on plant-pollinator interactions.    
Dr. Yahn-Jauh Su  
Technician in Michigan State University. I work for ecosystem carbon fluxes and pools in agricultural ecosystems and how carbon dynamics respond to disturbance.
